    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Looking for a unique dish to prepare on a weekend? Try this humble Philly Cheesesteak which is traditionally made using a long bread roll filled with sautéed meat and melted cheese, topped with some onions, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard and hot or sweet peppers. It has built a pretty big fan-base for itself. Did you know that the iconic Philly Cheesesteak was invented in 1930 in South Philly at Pat’s King of Steaks by Pat Olivieri, a hot-dog vendor? Legend has it that it was a taxi driver that first requested the variant and, having sampled it, told Olivieri to leave hot dogs behind and focus on steak sandwiches. Today, the cheesesteak has become an attraction of its own. So, if you’re craving a classic Philadelphia cheesesteak and looking to try your hand at cooking your perfect version of it, here's how you can make it at home. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients<em> (2 servings)</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150 gm thinly sliced chicken</li>
        <li>2 pieces cheese slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>black pepper as required</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 piece focaccia bread</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4><li>Saute the onions</li></h4>
            <p>To prepare this amazing cheesecake, put a large sauteing pan or a griddle on medium flame and heat oil in it. Add the onion in it along with salt and pepper to taste, and saute for 5 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally.</p>

        <h4><li>Cook the chicken in the pan</li></h4>
            <p>Next, add the shaved or handkerchief-thin slices of chicken with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Let each slice cook for roughly 45 seconds, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds.</p>

        <h4><li>Melt cheese slices on chicken steak</li></h4>
            <p>Finally, add cheese slices on top of chicken steak and cover to melt cheese (10 seconds). To assemble, transfer the steak, onions, and cheese onto sliced focaccia bread.</p>
    </ol>
